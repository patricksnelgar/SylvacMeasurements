        <item>The app will automatically scan for available devices each time it is opened. After
            10 seconds the scanning will stop. \n\nIf a rescan is required simply tap the
            \'refresh\' icon in the title bar (next to the \"Sylvac Calipers\" text) . This will start another 10 second scan for Bluetooth devices.</item>
        <item>For a new device: New devices will appear on the \"Scan\" screen, simply tap the device you wish to connect to. Upon a successful connection the Bluetooth symbol on the calipers should be solid. \n\nFor previous connections: Try the method for a new device,
            if this does not succeed then try resetting the calipers and using the
            \'Disconnect device\' option from the menu.</item>
        <item>To reset the calipers: Navigate to the \'bt\' menu, then cycle through the options under the \'bt\' menu until \'reset\' is displayed and select it.</item>
        <item>Press the \'send data\' button on the calipers when you want to record a
            measurement. A beep will sound when the measurement is received by the app (make sure
            the media volume is turned up). \n\nUpon receiving X number of measurements (where X is the value; Settings -> Values per Entry) a new entry will be appended to the bottom of the \'Data\' tab. The measurements in the current record will be displayed under the
            \'Current ID\' section</item>
        <item>The device automatically saves data to a predetermined file upon the completion of X measurements being received. Settings for enabling the autosave feature and that name of the file can be found under \'Data Preferences\'</item>
        <item>To save all the entries in the \"Data\" tab, tap the \'save\' icon next to the
            \'refresh\' icon in the title bar. This will open a dialog popup requesting the name of the file to use. Note that only the file name is required, the file type is automatically set to \".csv\".</item>
        <item>As of Android version 6.0, there has been changes to the way security works.
            The app now requires access to the location services in order to receive
            Bluetooth scan results. \n\n In addition to this, if no devices are shown in
            the scan results try enabling the \'GPS/Location\' feature of the device
            and
            try scanning again.
